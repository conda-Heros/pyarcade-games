* Quiz Game CLI


>A set of  general questions the  players attempt to answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects. the players will get a plus point for each correct answer


* Snake game

>The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves.
